## Implementation Notes

### Day 1 (2025-07-14)
- Completed project analysis
- Finalized detailed implementation plan for Phase 1
- Set up progress tracking structure
- Next steps: Begin Scale Estimation System implementation

### Day 1 (2025-07-14. cont.)
- Completed Scale Estimation System implementation
- Implemented exception hierarchy for robust error handling
- Created abstract base class for scale estimators
- Integrated with existing calibration code
- Developed manager class for multiple estimator support
- Modernized calibration code to handle different image modes and eliminate deprecation warnings
- Reorganized CLI structure with modular command groups:
  - Legacy functionality moved to 'v1' subcommand
  - New scale commands under 'scale' namespace
  - Backward compatibility entry point (tem-seg-v1)
- Added comprehensive integration tests:
  - CLI structure and help messages validation
  - Scale detection with normal, fallback, and skip-missing options
  - Debug mode with detailed error tracing
  - CSV output and multiple image processing
  - Legacy v1 command backward compatibility
  - Error handling for missing images
- All tests passing with no warnings

### Day 2 (2025-07-15)
- Completed Model Configuration System refactoring:
  - Implemented architecture-specific model configuration structure
  - Created BaseModelConfig abstract base class and UNetConfig implementation
  - Developed model registry pattern with factory functions
  - Added validation for architecture-specific parameters
  - Ensured backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Enhanced CLI system:
  - Consolidated organelle enums into a single `OrganelleType` class
  - Added configuration commands under 'config' namespace
  - Improved error handling and user feedback
  - Fixed bug in Scale Estimation CLI debug mode where `status` variable was undefined
- Comprehensive code quality improvements:
  - Added `ruff` for linting and code quality
  - Reorganized imports to follow consistent ordering and grouping
  - Fixed string quoting and spacing consistency
  - Removed unnecessary comments and improved docstrings
  - Ensured clean code organization and logical structure
