# Progress Report: Model Configuration Refactoring and CLI Integration

**Date**: 2025-07-15
**Milestone**: Model Configuration System and CLI Enhancement
**Status**: Completed 

## Summary
We've successfully completed the model configuration system refactoring, moving from a generic `ModelConfig` to architecture-specific configuration classes. This represents a significant advance in the Phase 1 foundation infrastructure, implementing features that were originally planned for later phases. The configuration system now supports the model registry pattern, architecture-specific parameters, and enhanced validation while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Recent Improvements

- Implemented architecture-specific model configuration structure (`BaseModelConfig`, `UNetConfig`)
- Created model registry pattern with factory functions for extensibility
- Consolidated organelle enums into a single `OrganelleType` class inheriting from `str` and `Enum` for better CLI compatibility
- Updated configuration validation with multiple validation levels (STRICT, WARNING, IGNORE)
- Added configuration CLI commands for generating and validating model configurations
- Improved code quality through linting and consistent formatting
- Fixed bug in Scale Estimation CLI debug mode
- Restructured the CLI with namespaced commands while maintaining backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Architecture-Specific Model Configuration**
   - Implemented `BaseModelConfig` abstract base class with common model parameters
   - Created `UNetConfig` with architecture-specific parameters like depth and attention gates
   - Added validation for architecture-specific parameters
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing workflows

2. **Model Registry Pattern**
   - Implemented model registry for dynamically registering and retrieving model architectures
   - Created factory functions for instantiating models based on configuration
   - Added support for future extensibility with new architecture types

3. **CLI Enum Consolidation**
   - Consolidated organelle type enums into a single `OrganelleType` class 
   - Improved CLI argument parsing with string-based enums
   - Removed redundant mappings between CLI arguments and internal representations

4. **Configuration Validation**
   - Implemented multi-level validation (STRICT, WARNING, IGNORE)
   - Added comprehensive validation for all configuration parameters
   - Created helpful error messages and validation warnings

### Modifications and Testing

1. **Configuration Presets**
   - Updated all preset configurations to use `UNetConfig` instead of `ModelConfig`
   - Added missing parameters like `depth` and `use_attention` to preset configurations
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing workflows

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Updated all tests to use the new model configuration structure
   - Fixed assertions to match new defaults and parameter names
   - Ensured all tests pass with the new configuration system
   - Added test cases for configuration validation at different levels

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Added `ruff` for linting and code quality
   - Removed unnecessary comments and improved docstrings
   - Fixed string quoting and spacing consistency
   - Ensured clean code organization and logical structure

## Integration with Existing Systems

The model configuration refactoring connects with the following existing components:

1. **CLI System**
   - Added configuration subcommands under `tem-seg config` namespace
   - Maintained backward compatibility with `v1` commands
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

2. **Scale Estimation System**
   - Ensured compatibility with scale system through workflow configuration
   - Fixed bug in Scale Estimation CLI debug mode where `status` variable was undefined

## Next Steps

1. **Workflow Base Classes**
   - Implement `SegmentationWorkflow` abstract base class using the new configuration system
   - Create standardized output system for predictions
   - Add directory structure management for workflow artifacts

2. **Complete Configuration System**
   - Add configuration migration utilities for existing models
   - Implement hash-based configuration versioning
   - Create configuration presets for additional organelles

3. **TensorFlow UNet Migration**
   - Update existing UNet implementation to use the new configuration system
   - Migrate training and prediction code to the workflow architecture
   - Ensure compatibility with existing model weights

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding additional model architecture configurations (DeepLabV3, etc.)
- Explore configuration versioning for reproducibility
- Investigate configuration validation extensions for more complex dependencies between parameters
